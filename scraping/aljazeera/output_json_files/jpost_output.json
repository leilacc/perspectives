(photo credit:Wikimedia Commons) Fatou Bensouda, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, on  Thursday rejected a request to open a full investigation against Israeli  soldiers and leaders regarding the raid on theMavi Marmarain  2010.Comoros, a Sunni island nation located between Mozambique and  Madagascar, had submitted the war crimes complaints and request for  investigation.The Foreign Ministry had this to say: &ldquo;Israel takes  positive note of the decision by the prosecutor of the International Criminal  Court to close the preliminary examination into the flotilla (Mavi  Marmara).&rdquo;The Jerusalem Post learned of Bensouda&rsquo;s ruling before it was  publicized, noting that her decision said that the incident did not rise to the  level of severity of broad-based war crimes allegations that the ICC is  empowered to deal with.In other words, the ICC deals only with cases  where there was major fighting and war crimes allegations involving much larger  numbers of deaths &ndash; as opposed to theMavi Marmararaid that involved nine  deaths and a contained, short conflict on one vessel.Although there are  still proceedings in Turkey on the issue, the ICC&rsquo;s ruling likely puts the  incident to rest after several Israeli, Turkish and UN-related reports have  addressed the fallout from it.In May 2010, a group of foreign activists,  along with a smaller group of activists from a Turkish NGO, IHH (which the  quasi-government Turkel Commission Report identified as affiliated with the  Muslim Brotherhood) boarded several ships to try to break Israel&rsquo;s blockade of  Hamas in the Gaza Strip.While Israel commandeered and stopped most of  the ships without incident, when Israel Navy commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara,  IHH activists attacked them, leading to some commandos being wounded and nine  deaths on the IHH side.Turkey and many others in the international  community accused Israel of war crimes, but the Turkel Commission and the  UN-sponsored Palmer Report cleared Israel of war crimes, validated some of  Israel&rsquo;s narrative of fighting in self-defense or said that there was not  sufficient evidence to come after Israel for war crimes, even as the Palmer  Report said that some of the commandos used excessive force.Comoros  filed its complaint against the IDF and some Israeli leaders in May 2013, with  scholarly briefs coming in for and against from a variety of sources since  then.Many viewed Comoros as pursuing the issue on behalf of various  IHH-Turkish contacts due to the law firm that filed the  complaint.Despite rejecting the Comoros complaints, the ICC prosecutor&rsquo;s  decision included a number of statements against Israel&rsquo;s position in terms of  possible war crimes having been permitted and referring to Israel as a  conquering power.Bensouda said that despite her final decision, that if  the case had gone forward, &ldquo;there is a reasonable basis to believe that war  crimes&rdquo; were committed by Israel during the incident.Noting Israel&rsquo;s  view that its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip nine years ago freed it from any  argument of legally occupying Gaza, Bensouda wrote, &ldquo;however, the prevalent view  within the international community is that Israel remains an occupying power in  Gaza despite the 2005 disengagement.&rdquo;The Foreign Ministry responded  saying, &ldquo;It should be emphasized that the examination conducted was preliminary  only, and the prosecutor decided to close the file without seeing a need to  address the issue of resort to self-defense by IDF soldiers who were confronted,  as mentioned in the report, by violence from IHH activists in the context of a  flotilla which the prosecutor considered as not constituting a humanitarian  mission.&rdquo;The ministry statement continued, &ldquo;It should be noted that any  preliminary statement by the prosecutor regarding the conduct of IDF soldiers  without addressing at all the central issue of self-defense which would justify  the resort to force and without conducting a thorough investigation of the  incident itself, is bound to lead to distorted and misleading  statements.&rdquo;The response also noted that Bensouda did not analyze the  issue of complimentarity &ndash; meaning the question of whether Israel had  investigated the allegations properly &ndash; an important point, since the ICC cannot  intervene if a country carries out its own competent  investigations.Earlier, the Post had learned that while Israel would  have preferred the statements, about a reasonable basis to believe that war  crimes were committed, and the prevalent view within the international community  regarding the issue of occupation, that when viewing the entire decision in  context, these statements were considered qualified and to have little  precedential value.
